# Movie-Recommendation -System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using the TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset.
It analyzes movie metadata such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview, converts them into numerical vectors, and recommends the top 5 most similar movies to the user.
The system also fetches movie posters and extra details in real time using the TMDB API and displays everything through an interactive Streamlit web app.
